# Artificial Intelligence and the Internet-of-Things

These are the lab exercises and and lab sheets for the Internet -of-Things part of the Artificial Intelligence and the Internet-of-Things module at Sheffield Hallam University.  

This academic year (2024-25) we are using the [Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 boards](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/mkr-wifi-1010) to develop Internet-of-Things applications. 

The Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 boards provide a simple to use platform based around the SAMD21 Cortex M0+ MCU and the U-Blox NINA-W102 WiFi module.
